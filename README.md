Addressing Inequality Through Local Sign Language Learning
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) emphasizes the need to empower and promote social, economic, and political inclusion for all, irrespective of age, disability, race, or socioeconomic status. One of the major barriers faced by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community is the lack of accessibility to local sign language learning tools. Communication challenges often lead to social isolation, limited employment opportunities, and restricted access to essential services.
This project aims to bridge the communication gap by developing a localized sign language learning application, ensuring accessibility for individuals who want to learn and interact using sign language. By providing an easy-to-use mobile solution, the app fosters inclusivity, education, and social empowerment—helping individuals, educators, and families connect seamlessly with the DHH community.
Technologies and Features
This project utilizes Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, enabling seamless performance on both Android and iOS devices with a single codebase. The app integrates Firebase for secure backend services such as authentication, cloud storage, and real-time updates—making it scalable and reliable for future enhancements.
For sign language detection, a TensorFlow/Keras machine learning model trained on thousands of ASL images provides accurate gesture recognition, while MediaPipe ensures robust hand tracking. A lightweight Flask API connects the frontend with the model to enable real-time predictions.
These tools were chosen for their efficiency, accessibility, and open-source support, allowing the app to be developed rapidly and deployed widely. By leveraging these technologies, this app empowers individuals to learn sign language anytime, anywhere—helping bridge communication gaps and reduce inequalities faced by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.
Note: The file ASLAPP.apk is the APK version of the app; however, there are chances that it might not function properly due to the large model size (1.5GB), which couldn't be uploaded. The model is also not available in the project zip file attached to the Google form.
